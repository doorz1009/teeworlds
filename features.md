# Feature: Dodgeball Mode

## Feature 1: One-Hit Kill:
### User Story:
As a teeworlds user, I would like for the enemy hit by the ball to be out of the game after one hit so that the game is similar to the way that dodgeball really works.

## Feature 2: Respawn on Killer's Death:
### User Story:
As a teeworlds user, I would like to respawn when the enemy that killed me is killed so that this game mode will be similar to the way that dodgeball is really played.

## Feature 3: Round End on No Enemies Remaining:
### User Story:
As a tee worlds user, I would like be able to win the game when all enemy players have been eliminated so that this game mode works like dodgeball really does.
